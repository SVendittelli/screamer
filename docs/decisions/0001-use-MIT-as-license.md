# License the work under MIT

## Context and Problem Statement

Everything needs to be licensed, otherwise the default copyright laws apply.
For instance, in Germany that means users may not alter anything without explicitly asking for permission.
For more information see <https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/>.

We want people to be able to use and adapt screamer easily.

## Considered Options

- [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)
- BSD3
- MIT
- No license
- Other open source licenses

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MIT", because
it is simple and contains attribution.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

## CC0

- Good, because this license donates the content to "public domain" and does so as legally as possible.
- Bad, because it does not contain attribution - and [attribution is important](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/9126/5671).

## BSD3

- Bad, because it [is unclear whether it can be used for documentation](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/9545/5671)

## MIT

- Good, because it [explicitly may be used for documentation](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/9545/5671)
- Good, because it is lean.
